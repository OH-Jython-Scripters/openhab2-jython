# Jython (Python) Help Libraries for openHAB Scripted Automation

These libraries can be used with [openHAB](http://openhab.org/) (2.4 stable, 2.5M1, or post OH 2.4 S1318) and the new rule engine. 
The one exception is the 'System started' trigger, which requires S1566 or later.

A previous version that is compatible with earlier versions of OH, but with reduced functionality, has been archived to [this branch](https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/openhab2-jython/tree/original_(%3C%3D2.3)).

These works are based on the original contributions of Steve Bate, for which we are very thankful!  :vulcan_salute:
