Welcome to the openHAB Scripters Jython documentation!
******************************************************

This is a repository of experimental Jython code that can be used with the
`Eclipse SmartHome <https://www.eclipse.org/smarthome/>`_ platform and
`openHAB 2.x <http://openhab.org/>`_ (post OH snapshot build 1318).
A previous version with reduced functionality, but compatible with OH 2.3, has
been archived in this
`branch <https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/openhab2-jython/tree/original_(%3C%3D2.3)>`_.

These works are based on the original contributions of Steve Bate, for which we
are very thankful!

.. note::
    The following documentation assumes that you have chosen to use Jython for
    JSR223 scripting in openHAB because you have at least a basic understanding
    of Python. If you have come here with no knowledge of Python, we recommend
    seeking out some tutorials to get you started with the language, such as
    `learnpython.org <https://www.learnpython.org/>`_.
