## openHAB compatibility
IdeAlarm currently works with openHAB 2.3 only. ideAlarm is currently awaiting to be merged into the [Jython scripting for openHAB 2.x](https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/openhab2-jython) repo for compatibility with later versions of openHAB.


## Stage of development
This software should be considered to be in it's early stage of development. It is working without any known issues in a couple of installations. We are currently looking for people interested to contribute to this project. Please join the OH-Jython-Scripters team if you feel that you can contribute in any way. We need testers, developers, and native english speakers to give the [Wiki](https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/ideAlarm/wiki) an overhaul.

In case you decide to install and try this software in it's current state, you should already have some skills when it comes to openHAB, Jython scripting and the Linux environment.
