'''
This script speaks a random greeting every minute on your Sonos speaker system.
To use this, you should set up astro.py as described here
https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/openhab2-jython/blob/master/Design%20Pattern%20Examples/Time%20of%20Day.
It also assumes that you've set up an openHAB contact items to represent the presence of
persons to be greeted. Each item should belong to the item group "G_Presence_Family".

Finally make sure that you add the contents of the configuration.py.example file
into your own configuration file:
'''

    peopleAtHome = []
    for member in itemRegistry.getItem('G_Presence_Family').getAllMembers():
