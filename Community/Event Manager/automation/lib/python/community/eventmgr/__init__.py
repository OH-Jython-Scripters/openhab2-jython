:Version: **1.0.0**

Astro service that offers event subscriptions. This software is distributed as a
community submission to the `openhab-helper-libraries <https://github.com/openhab-scripters/openhab-helper-libraries>`_.


About
-----

The module offers the possibility to subscribe to Cron and Astro events, as well as an option of defining a TimeOfDay sequence, 
which is also subscribeable. The integration to the Astro binding from jsr223 scripts. The problem with the Atro Binding in openHAB2 
is that you can have channel triggers (eg. sunrise, sunset), but the value is (obviously) first set when the trigger fires. The other 
option was to map the channel to an item (which gets initialized), and then subscribe to that item. The Event Manager handles this, 
and makes it possible to subscribe to events and also query the actual value (at any time). So all you have to do is to subscribe to a 
particular Astro Event or Cron Trigger.
